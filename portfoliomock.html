              <h2>Branding Myself</h2>
              
              <p>This year, I have been focused on building a brand. Who am I? How do I want to be thought of as a designer? What aspect of design do I want to focus on? </p>
              
              <p>Through using my initials and based on my characteristics I have designed a monogram, wordmark and visual mark to represent me as a designer. These are accompanied with a set of professional style guidelines to ensure consistency throughout the brand.</p>

              <p>There are hundreds of amazing designers in the world, but in my eyes, there are none more interesting and unpredictable than Stefan Sagmeister.</p>
              
              <p>For this reason, this is who I chose to base my designer essay on. As part of the project, I was also tasked with coding the essay into a website to make it a bit more visually appealing. Take a look! </p>

              <p>Have you ever felt like a holiday could’ve had more potential? Or that the stereotypical recommendations just aren’t cutting it for you? You need something tailored for YOU! </p>

                  <p>This is why I have designed your <a href="https://ethanmcgonigle.tumblr.com/search/avatar"><i><b>very own avatar</b></i></a>, TravelBud! TravelBud takes into account your interests and wants to recommend the best things to do specifically for YOU! so that you never have any holiday hindsights again.</p>

          <p>Data visualisation can often be boring; colourless pages packed with monotonous statistics and information. I was tasked with designing an infographic poster that was illustrative and engaging. I created colourful icons and used concise explanations that were easy to read and understand. </p>
              
          <p>I decided to base mine on the topic of knife crime in the UK. Take a look!</p>
